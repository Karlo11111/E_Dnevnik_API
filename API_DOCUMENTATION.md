# E-Dnevnik API — Documentation

**Version:** 1.0
**Base URL (production):** `https://your-app.herokuapp.com`
**Base URL (local):** `http://localhost:5168`
**Protocol:** HTTPS required in production

---

## What is this API?

The E-Dnevnik API is a REST API that gives you programmatic access to data from
the Croatian school portal **ocjene.skole.hr** (e-Dnevnik). The portal has no
official public API, so this service securely logs in on your behalf, scrapes the
relevant pages, and returns clean structured JSON.

**What you can fetch:**
- Your subjects, professors, and average grades
- Detailed grade breakdown per subject (by month and evaluation element)
- Upcoming written exams
- Recently entered grades and newly added exams
- Your absences
- Your weekly timetable
- Your student profile (name, school, class, class master)
- Grades from all past school years

**What the API never does:**
- Store your password — it is used once to log in and immediately discarded
- Keep your personal data persistently — everything lives in memory only
- Access anything beyond what you would see logged into e-Dnevnik yourself

---

## How authentication works

Authentication is a two-step process: you log in once to get a token, then
include that token in every subsequent request.

### Step 1 — Login

Send your AAI e-Dnevnik credentials to the login endpoint. The API logs into
e-Dnevnik on your behalf and returns a **Bearer token**.

```
POST /api/Login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "ime.prezime@skole.hr",
  "password": "<your-ednevnik-password>"
}
```

**Successful response (200):**
```json
{
  "token": "abc123XYZ...base64encodedstring=="
}
```

**Failed responses:**

| Code | Body | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| `400` | `"Email i lozinka moraju biti uneseni."` | Missing fields |
| `429` | `"previše neuspjelih pokušaja prijave. pokušaj ponovo za 15 minuta."` | Brute force lockout |
| `401` | `"prijava nije uspjela, provjeri email i lozinku."` | Wrong credentials |
| `500` | `"csrf token nije pronađen."` | e-Dnevnik is unreachable |

### Step 2 — Use the token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer abc123XYZ...base64encodedstring==
```

### Token lifetime

Your token is valid for **24 hours** from the last time you used it. Every
successful API call resets this timer (sliding window). If the token expires
or is invalid, any endpoint will return `401` — simply log in again to get a
new one.

### Logging out

To invalidate your session immediately on the server:

```
DELETE /api/Login
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

Returns `200` on success. After this the token stops working immediately.

---

### New grades

**`GET /api/Scraper/ScrapeNewGrades`**

Returns grades that have been recently entered by teachers. This endpoint is
**cached server-side** — the server refreshes it every 5 minutes in the background
for all active sessions, so repeat calls return instantly.

**Request:**
```
GET /api/Scraper/ScrapeNewGrades
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response (200) — grades exist:**
```json
{
  "grades": [
    {

      "subjectName": "Matematika",
      "description": "Pisana provjera - Integrali",
      "gradeNumber": "4",
      "elementOfEvaluation": "Pisana provjera znanja"
    }
  ]
}

```json
{
  "grades": null
}
```

---

### New tests

**`GET /api/Scraper/ScrapeNewTests`**

Returns exams that have been recently added by teachers. Also **cached server-side**
and refreshed every 5 minutes — same caching behaviour as new grades.

**Request:**
```
GET /api/Scraper/ScrapeNewTests
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response (200) — tests exist:**
```json
{
  "tests": [

    }
  ]
}
```

---

subjects are split into `PON Morning` / `PON Afternoon` etc.

**Request:**
```
GET /api/Scraper/ScrapeScheduleTable
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response (200) — single shift:**
```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "day": "PON",
      "subjects": ["Matematika", "Fizika", "Engleski jezik", "Kemija", "Tjelesna i zdravstvena kultura"]
    },

    }
  ]
}
```

Days returned: `PON`, `UTO`, `SRI`, `ČET`, `PET`, `SUB` (only days with classes appear).

---

### All past school years

**`GET /api/Scraper/ScrapeDifferentGrades`**

Returns subjects and final grades for every school year the student has attended,
not just the current one.

> ⚠️ **This endpoint is slow.** It navigates through multiple pages on e-Dnevnik
> (one per school year, plus individual subject pages for any subject without an
> average grade). Expect 10–60 seconds depending on how many years of history exist.
> Use it sparingly and cache the result on the client side.

**Request:**
```
GET /api/Scraper/ScrapeDifferentGrades
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response (200):**
```json
[
  {
    "gradeName": "4.b",
    "subjects": [
      {
        "subjectName": "Matematika",
        "professorName": "Marko Marković",
        "grade": "4",
        "subjectId": "75229928950"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "gradeName": "3.b",
    "subjects": [
      {
        "subjectName": "Matematika",
        "professorName": "Marko Marković",
        "grade": "5",
        "subjectId": "74110928740"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

---

### Missed class percentages

**`GET /api/Scraper/CalculateMissedClassPercentages`**

Combines your timetable and absences to calculate what percentage of each
subject's yearly hours you have missed. Uses the timetable to estimate the
yearly fund of hours (weekly hours × 35 weeks ÷ 2 for semester rotation).

**Request:**
```
GET /api/Scraper/CalculateMissedClassPercentages
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "Matematika": "3.57%",
  "Fizika": "0.00%",
  "Engleski jezik": "7.14%"
}
```

---

## Error reference

Every endpoint can return these responses:

| Code | Meaning | When it happens |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `200` | Success | Request completed, response body contains data |
| `400` | Bad request | Missing or invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Token missing, expired, or invalid — log in again |
| `429` | Too many requests | Either rate limit (20 req/min) or brute force lockout (5 failed logins → 15 min) |
| `500` | Server error | e-Dnevnik is down, returned unexpected HTML, or internal error |

**401 response body:**
```json
"Sesija je istekla ili token nije valjan. Potrebna je ponovna prijava."
```

**429 response body (rate limit):**
```json
{ "error": "previše zahtjeva, pokušaj ponovo za minutu." }
```

**429 response body (brute force):**
```json
"previše neuspjelih pokušaja prijave. pokušaj ponovo za 15 minuta."
```

---

## Rate limiting

The API enforces a limit of **20 requests per minute per IP address**. Exceeding
this returns `429`. The limit is shared across all endpoints — login calls count
toward the same quota.

For the login endpoint specifically, **5 consecutive failed attempts** on the same
email address triggers an additional 15-minute lockout for that email, regardless
of IP. A successful login resets the counter.

---

## Health check

**`GET /health`**

No authentication required. Returns `200` if the API is running.

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

Use this to verify the server is up before making authenticated calls.

## Notes for developers

- **Timeout:** Set your HTTP client timeout to at least **120 seconds**. The
  `ScrapeDifferentGrades` endpoint can take over a minute for students with many
  years of history.

- **Null grades:** When a subject has no average grade on the list page (common
  for subjects still in progress), the API navigates to the individual subject
  page to find the final grade. If neither exists, `grade` is returned as `"N/A"`.

- **New grades / new tests caching:** The server caches these two endpoints per
  user session and refreshes them automatically every 5 minutes in the background.
  The first call after login will be slow (~2s). All calls within the next 5 minutes
  return the cached result instantly.

- **School year auto-selection:** After login, the API automatically activates the
  most recent school year on e-Dnevnik. This ensures that endpoints like subjects
  and absences return data even after the current school year has ended and the
  portal has no "active" class selected by default.

- **Swagger UI:** When running locally in development, Swagger UI is available at
  `http://localhost:5168/swagger` for interactive testing of all endpoints.
